## Why You Should Care
As Patrick Stump keenly observed, “Speed is absolutely key to creativity. The more time it takes to create something, the less likely you are to create something.”  Although the DSU IA Lab provides students a platform for learning and exploring via virtual machines, interfacing with the online tool is often slow.  Obtaining access to the internet is sometimes challenging due to the school’s firewall and if DSU’s network is down, then students may not be able to conduct their research at all.  
Cyber operations PhD students have many reasons for establishing a home VMware lab vice using DSU’s.  In addition to the examples cited above, students will benefit from having access to virtual machine labs long after DSU’s standard lease of 60 days expires.  Research in one class may carry over to the next; and having virtual machines setup to personal preferences will allow students to streamline the process whenever virtual machines are required.  As researchers of malicious code, the likelihood of leveraging a virtual machine lab extends well beyond classroom assignments to include completing dissertations, professional endeavors and personal curiosity.
But isn’t it easier to use DSU’s IA Lab?  I’m not sure if my computer can support running VMWare?  This project is designed to answer these questions.  Ultimately, relying on DSU’s IA Lab is not an ideal situation is an alternative is available.  Students will likely want to purchase a computer than can support running multiple virtual machines, and analysis of hardware performance will inform us as to what a student may desire if purchasing new hardware is considered.
