## Why You Should Care
As Patrick Stump keenly observed, “Speed is absolutely key to creativity. The more time it takes to create something, the less likely you are to create something.”  Although the DSU IA Lab provides students a platform for learning and exploring via virtual machines, interfacing with the online tool is often slow.  Obtaining access to the internet is sometimes challenging due to the school’s firewall and if DSU’s network is down, then students may not be able to conduct their research at all.  
  
Cyber Operations PhD students have many reasons for establishing a home VMware lab vice using DSU’s.  In addition to the examples cited above, students will benefit from having access to virtual machine labs long after DSU’s standard lease of 45 days expires.  Research in one class may carry over to the next; and having virtual machines setup to personal preferences will allow students to streamline the process whenever virtual machines are required.  As researchers of malicious code, the likelihood of leveraging a virtual machine lab extends well beyond classroom assignments to include completing dissertations, professional endeavors, and personal curiosity.
  
But isn’t it easier to use DSU’s IA Lab?  This project is designed to demonstrate the process for setting up a home VMware lab to answer this exact question.  Ultimately, if relying on DSU’s IA Lab is not an ideal situation is an alternative is available then students may want to purchase a computer that can support running multiple virtual machines.  The following analysis across different hardware configurations will inform us as to what a student may desire if purchasing hardware is considered.
  
## Three Main Ideas
1. Setting up a home VMWare lab is not difficult.
1. Home VMWare lab is signficantly faster than DSU's IA lab.
2. Different hardware setups will produce significantly different performance results.

## Future Direction
This topic could be further explored by examining more hardware configurations and conducting additional performance analysis.  
## Stream of Topics
Additional topics for consideration include:

- Topic 1
- Topic 2
- Topic 3
## Additional Resources
- [Briant Becote CSC840 Final](https://github.com/DSU-Projects/CSC840-Final) Link to the github page this README is hosted on.
- [VMWare Workstation Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Workstation-Pro/index.html) With VMware Workstation Pro, you can run multiple operating systems simultaneously on the same PC, create powerful virtual machines to run the most demanding applications, and create restricted virtual machines that can expire.
- [DSU Software Webstore](https://dsu.onthehub.com/) OnTheHub provides students, faculty and staff with discounted and free academic software.  Here, students can get the latest applications and programs from organizations like Microsoft, Adobe, and VMware for up to 90% off or even free. 
- [Blender Benchmark](https://www.blender.org/news/introducing-blender-benchmark/) A platform to collect and display the results of hardware and software performance tests. With this benchmark we aim at an optimal comparison between system hardware and installations, and to assist developers to track performance during Blender development.The benchmark consists of a downloadable package which runs Blender and renders on several production files.
- [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the world’s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers*. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.
